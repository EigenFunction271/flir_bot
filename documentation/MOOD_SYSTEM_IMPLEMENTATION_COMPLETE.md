## 🎯 How It Works

### Complete Flow (Turn-by-Turn)

```
USER SENDS MESSAGE
↓
FOR EACH CHARACTER:
  ↓
  1. GET CURRENT MOOD from session
  ↓
  2. LLM INFERS NEW MOOD
     Inputs: character personality, user message, conversation history
     Output: {mood: "frustrated", intensity: 0.8, reason: "...", triggers: ["excuse"]}
  ↓
  3. MATCH BEHAVIOR RULES
     IF mood=frustrated AND user said "excuse" AND intensity >= 0.6
     THEN apply behaviors: ["Be terse", "Show impatience"]
  ↓
  4. GENERATE DYNAMIC PROMPT
     Base prompt + aggressive_instructions + mood_instructions
  ↓
  5. LLM GENERATES RESPONSE
     Using mood-aware prompt
  ↓
  6. UPDATE SESSION
     Save new mood state
  ↓
  7. SEND TO DISCORD
     With mood color & emoji indicator
```

### Example: Marcus Emotional Arc

**Turn 1:** User: "I can't make that deadline"
- Current: IMPATIENT (0.7)
- LLM inference: FRUSTRATED (0.7) - "User making excuses"
- Rules match: FRUSTRATED + "can't"
- Behaviors: "Use terse responses", "Show impatience"
- Response: "I don't want to hear that. Find a way."
- Discord: 🧡 Orange embed, 😤 frustrated emoji

**Turn 2:** User: "But it's impossible!"
- Current: FRUSTRATED (0.7)
- LLM inference: ANGRY (0.9) - "User continues excuses after warning"
- Rules match: ANGRY + "impossible" + high intensity
- Behaviors: "Use CAPS", "Threaten consequences", "Be hostile"
- Response: "That's YOUR problem! Either deliver or you're FIRED!"
- Discord: ❤️ Red embed, 😠 angry emoji

**Turn 3:** User: "Here's my detailed plan with timeline..."
- Current: ANGRY (0.9)
- LLM inference: SKEPTICAL (0.6) - "User proposed solution, need to verify"
- Rules match: SKEPTICAL + "plan"
- Behaviors: "Show slight interest", "Demand details", "Stay guarded"
- Response: "Hmm. Walk me through the dependencies."
- Discord: 🧡 Orange embed, 🤨 skeptical emoji

**Turn 4:** User: "Backend API ready Monday, QA can run parallel..."
- Current: SKEPTICAL (0.6)
- LLM inference: IMPRESSED (0.7) - "User provided concrete details"
- Rules match: IMPRESSED + "data"
- Behaviors: "Acknowledge competence", "Still maintain authority"
- Response: "Fine. You've thought this through. Two weeks. Don't disappoint me."
- Discord: 💚 Green embed, 😮 impressed emoji

session = {
    "scenario": Scenario,
    "characters": [CharacterPersona, ...],
    "context": str,
    "current_character": CharacterPersona,
    "conversation_history": [Dict, ...],
    "turn_count": int,
    "created_at": datetime,
    
    # NEW: Character moods
    "character_moods": {
        "marcus": MoodState(
            current_mood=CharacterMood.FRUSTRATED,
            intensity=0.8,

}
```

## 🔧 Testing the System

### Manual Test Steps

1. **Start a scenario:**
   ```
   !start workplace_deadline
   ```

2. **Check initial moods in logs:**
   ```
   🎭 INIT: Marcus starting mood: impatient
   🎭 INIT: Sarah starting mood: neutral
   ```

3. **Make an excuse:**
   ```
   User: "I can't make that deadline"
   ```

4. **Observe mood changes:**
   ```
   🎭 MOOD: Marcus mood updated: frustrated (intensity: 0.7)
   📊 Reason: User making excuses
   ✅ Triggers: ['excuse', 'can't']
   ```

5. **Check Discord embed:**
   - Should show orange color
   - Footer: "😤 frustrated • Turn 1/3"

6. **Escalate:**
   ```
   User: "But it's impossible!"
   ```

7. **Observe escalation:**
   ```
   🎭 MOOD: Marcus mood updated: angry (intensity: 0.9)
   📊 Mood Transition: frustrated → angry
   ```

8. **Propose solution:**
   ```
   User: "Here's my detailed plan with dependencies..."
   ```

9. **Observe de-escalation:**
   ```
   🎭 MOOD: Marcus mood updated: skeptical (intensity: 0.6)
   ```

### Expected Log Output

```
🎭 INIT: Marcus starting mood: impatient
🎭 MOOD: Starting mood inference for Marcus
🎭 MOOD: Current state: impatient (0.7)
🎭 MOOD: User message: 'I can't make that deadline'
🎭 MOOD: LLM raw response: {"mood":"frustrated","intensity":0.8...
✅ MOOD: Marcus mood updated: frustrated (intensity: 0.8)
✅ MOOD: Reason: User making excuses instead of taking responsibility
✅ MOOD: Triggers: ['excuse', 'can't']
🎭 PROMPT: Generated dynamic prompt for Marcus (mood: frustrated)
✅ RESPONSE: Generated for Marcus in mood frustrated
🎭 MOOD UPDATE: Marcus mood: impatient → frustrated
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables (No Changes Needed)

Existing configuration works:
- `GROQ_API_KEY` - Used for mood inference
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Discord bot
- All existing config values

### Performance

**Per character response:**
- LLM mood inference: 0.5-1.5s
- Rule matching: 0.01s
- Prompt generation: 0.01s
- LLM response: 1-2s
- **Total: ~2-3.5s**

**For 2 characters:**
- Sequential: ~4-7s
- (Future: Parallel inference could reduce to ~3-4s)

---

## 🐛 Backward Compatibility

### Old Sessions
- Sessions without `character_moods` field automatically get empty dict
- System creates default moods on first use
- No breaking changes

### Old Code Paths
- `generate_system_prompt()` still works (creates neutral mood)
- Response generation without mood state falls back gracefully
- Existing commands unchanged

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Phase 4: Custom Character Rules (Optional)

Add character-specific rules for Marcus and Patricia:

```python
# In characters.py CharacterManager._initialize_characters()
characters["marcus"].mood_behavior_rules = self._create_marcus_custom_rules()
```

See `mood_system_refactored.py` lines 526-613 for examples.

### Phase 5: Optimizations (Optional)

- Parallel mood inference for multiple characters
- Mood caching for rapid-fire messages (30s window)
- Skip inference for very short messages (<5 words)

### Phase 6: Analytics (Optional)

- Track mood distributions per character
- Show mood graph at end of scenario
- Include mood trajectory in feedback

## 📝 Summary

### What We Built

✅ **LLM determines emotions** (flexible, context-aware)  
✅ **Rules determine behaviors** (deterministic, controllable)  
✅ **Full Discord integration** (colors, emojis, persistence)  
✅ **Backward compatible** (no breaking changes)  
✅ **Production ready** (error handling, logging, fallbacks)

### Key Files

- `characters.py` - Core mood system & rules
- `mood_inference.py` - LLM mood detection
- `discord_bot.py` - Integration & UI
- `test_mood_system.py` - Unit tests
- `documentation/MOOD_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Full architecture

### The Result

Characters now have **dynamic emotional intelligence**:
- Feel emotions based on user actions
- Show those emotions through specific behaviors
- Persist emotional state across conversation
- Display emotional state visually in Discord

**Marcus isn't just "aggressive"** - he's:
- IMPATIENT when starting
- FRUSTRATED when you make excuses
- ANGRY when you keep making excuses
- SKEPTICAL when you propose solutions
- IMPRESSED when you present solid data

This makes conversations feel **alive and reactive** instead of robotic! 🎉
