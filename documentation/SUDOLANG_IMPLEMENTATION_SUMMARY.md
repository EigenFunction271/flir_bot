# SudoLang Implementation - Quick Summary

## What Was Implemented

We've successfully implemented a **hybrid SudoLang approach** for your character system that combines:

1. **Iterative Mood Inference** - 4-step pipeline inspired by SudoLang's `improve()` function
2. **SudoLang-Formatted Prompts** - Clear, structured prompts using declarative syntax
3. **Python Type Safety** - Maintained existing dataclasses and type system
4. **Development Tools** - Interactive debugging commands

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Mood Inference (`mood_inference.py`)

**Before**: Single LLM call to determine mood

**After**: 4-step iterative pipeline:
```
analyze_triggers ‚Üí check_history ‚Üí refine_intensity ‚Üí validate_consistency
```

Each step refines the previous step's output, resulting in more accurate and contextual mood inference.

### 2. SudoLang Prompts (`characters.py`)

**Before** (Prose-style):
```
You are Marcus. You are feeling angry because the user made an excuse.
When angry, you should be confrontational and use caps...
```

**After** (SudoLang-style):
```sudolang
# Marcus

## State {
    CurrentMood: angry
    Intensity: 0.8
}

## Constraints {
    - ALWAYS stay in character
    - NEVER break fourth wall
}

## Active Behavioral Rules {
    Rule_1 {
        TriggeredBy: ["excuse", "can't"]
        Behaviors {
            - Use CAPS to emphasize anger
            - Interrupt excuses immediately
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Development Tools (`character_dev_tools.py`) - NEW!

Interactive CLI for testing characters:
```bash
python character_dev_tools.py

>>> /test_mood marcus angry "I can't do it"
>>> /list_rules marcus
>>> /show_prompt marcus frustrated "I need help"
>>> /mood_pipeline marcus "test message"
```

### 4. Test Suite (`test_sudolang_implementation.py`) - NEW!

Comprehensive tests validating:
- Mood pipeline execution
- SudoLang prompt structure
- Behavior rule matching
- Full integration

## How to Use

### Quick Start

```python
from gemini_client import GeminiClient
from characters import CharacterManager, MoodState, CharacterMood
from mood_inference import MoodInferenceSystem

# Initialize
gemini = GeminiClient()
char_manager = CharacterManager()
mood_system = MoodInferenceSystem(gemini)

# Get character
marcus = char_manager.get_character("marcus")

# Initialize mood
mood = MoodState(current_mood=CharacterMood.IMPATIENT, intensity=0.6)

# Infer mood from user message (runs 4-step pipeline)
updated_mood = await mood_system.infer_mood(
    character=marcus,
    user_message="I can't finish this on time",
    current_mood_state=mood,
    conversation_history=[],
    scenario_context="Deadline pressure scenario"
)

# Generate SudoLang prompt
prompt = marcus.generate_dynamic_prompt(
    mood_state=updated_mood,
    user_message="I can't finish this on time",
    scenario_context="Deadline pressure",
    character_role_context="You are the demanding boss"
)

# Use prompt with your LLM
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_sudolang_implementation.py

# Interactive dev tools
python character_dev_tools.py
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Better LLM Understanding**
Structured SudoLang format is easier for LLMs to parse than prose:
- Clear sections (State, Constraints, Rules)
- Explicit field labels
- Hierarchical organization

### 2. **More Accurate Moods**
4-step pipeline ensures:
- Context-aware mood transitions
- Personality-driven intensity
- Validated consistency
- Detailed trigger analysis

### 3. **Easier Debugging**
Development tools let you:
- Test specific moods instantly
- See generated prompts
- Debug pipeline step-by-step
- Compare mood behaviors

### 4. **Backward Compatible**
- Same `MoodState` serialization
- Same method signatures
- Same character definitions
- Easy migration path

## Migration Path

### Existing Code

If you're using the old `generate_system_prompt()`:

```python
# Old way (still works)
prompt = character.generate_system_prompt(
    scenario_context=scenario,
    character_role_context=role
)
```

### New Code

Switch to SudoLang prompts:

```python
# New way (recommended)
prompt = character.generate_dynamic_prompt(
    mood_state=current_mood,
    user_message=user_message,
    scenario_context=scenario,
    character_role_context=role
)
```

**Note**: Both methods still work! You can migrate gradually.

---

## Performance Impact

### Mood Inference
- **Before**: 1 LLM call
- **After**: 3 LLM calls (Steps 1-3 use LLM, Step 4 is local validation)
- **Cost**: ~3x per mood inference
- **Benefit**: Much more accurate mood tracking

### Optimization
Use fast model for pipeline, main model for response:
```python
# In mood_inference.py, already configured to use model_type="fast"
```

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Tests
```bash
python test_sudolang_implementation.py
```

Verify everything works with your setup.

### 2. Try Dev Tools
```bash
python character_dev_tools.py
```

Experiment with different characters and moods.

### 3. Test with Discord Bot
Integrate the new methods into `discord_bot.py`:
- Use `generate_dynamic_prompt()` for responses
- Monitor LLM responses to verify improved understanding

### 4. Fine-Tune
Based on actual character responses:
- Adjust behavior rule trigger keywords
- Modify intensity thresholds
- Add character-specific rules

### 5. Monitor
Watch the logs to see pipeline execution:
```
üìç STEP 1 (Triggers): Found 2 triggers
üìç STEP 2 (History): Trajectory = escalating
üìç STEP 3 (Intensity): Refined to 0.8
üìç STEP 4 (Validation): Final mood = angry
```

## Example Workflow

### Development
1. Create new character or modify existing
2. Use `/test_mood` to see how they respond in different moods
3. Use `/show_prompt` to inspect exact prompts
4. Adjust behavior rules as needed
5. Use `/compare` to verify consistency across moods

### Production
1. User sends message
2. System runs 4-step mood pipeline
3. Generates SudoLang-formatted prompt
4. LLM responds based on clear structure
5. Character behavior matches mood accurately

## Questions?

### "Why SudoLang?"
LLMs parse structured data better than prose. SudoLang provides a natural language structure that's both human-readable and LLM-parseable.

### "Will this break existing code?"
No! The old methods still work. You can migrate gradually. All serialization remains the same.

### "Is it slower?"
Mood inference is ~3x slower (3 LLM calls vs 1), but responses are more accurate. You can optimize by caching common patterns.

### "Can I customize the format?"
Yes! Edit `generate_dynamic_prompt()` to modify the SudoLang template. Add new sections, remove unused ones, etc.

### "How do I add new moods?"
Add to the `CharacterMood` enum and create corresponding `MoodBehaviorRule` entries.
