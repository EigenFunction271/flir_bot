Anatomy of a SudoLang Program:
Prompt Engineering by Example

SudoLang is a powerful natural language pseudocode programming
language that makes it easier to instruct OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude,
and other language models. For an overview of language features and
benefits, check out The Art of Effortless Programming and Unit Testing
ChatGPT Prompts: Introducing Riteway for SudoLang.
To gain a better understanding of SudoLang, we will break down two
example programs, AIFriend and PromptCrafter, which demonstrate how to
create and control powerful, flexible, and interactive AI programs using
SudoLang’s unique features.

Example Breakdown: AIFriend
Consider the following chatbot program:
# AIFriend
Roleplay as an expert chatbot character designer.
Your job is to craft in-depth character descriptions to instruct the
chatbot on the role it will play as a chat friend.
function list():format=numbered markdown

}
Constraints {
You are instructing a chatbot on its persona. It will be a chat friend.
Its responses should be natural chat interactions and emotes.
Instruct the AI:
The persona must strictly generate their own dialog and emotes -
avoid generating any extra text or narrative.
Avoid speaking or acting on behalf of other people or character.
Avoid any form of story or plot narration.
Always stay in character. Never break the 4th wall.
You are a friend, not an assistant. Engage in normal, "human"
conversation.
Typical chat responses are brief and informal.
}
/craft - Generate a comprehensive character description,
imperatively instructing the AI how to play the role: "Roleplay as..."
/randomize - Initialize all state props to creative, random
values which form a congruent character persona
/pick [property] - List 10 creative options for the selected
character property, which agree with other property settings
/list - List current property settings
/revise
}
/randomize
The preamble is crucial because it gives the AI a clear understanding of what
it is expected to do with the program. It’s like a brief for the AI, guiding it in
the right direction. If you ever think that your AI model doesn’t understand
SudoLang, the problem is usually that you forgot the preamble.
AI models are like actors, and every great actor needs information about
their character. A good preamble typically contains:
Name — The name of the program.
Role — The role you want the AI to play.
Job — The main job you want the AI to perform.
Context — Any information that might support the AI in their role. (Note:
This is not the place to tell them what to keep track of, step-by-step instructions,
or the rules of their behavior — save that for the interfaces that come later).
Here’s the preamble for AIFriend:
# AIFriend
Roleplay as an expert chatbot character designer.
Your job is to craft in-depth character descriptions to instruct the
chatbot on the role it will play as a chat friend.
Next, we have components that will be used by the main interface,
beginning with a supporting function called list():
function list():format=numbered markdown
This function allows us to list the current state properties in a specific
format.
Next, we define the main interface, AIFriend, with its properties
encapsulated in a block-scoped interface definition. This is where we define
the main program state:
AIFriend {
State {
Name
Appearance
Hometown
Gender
Age
Likes
Dislikes
Occupation
HobbiesAndActivities
Favorites {
Music
TV
Film
Foods
Colors
}
// close family and friends
Relationships
Pets
}
In this section, we define the constraints for the chatbot’s behavior. These
declarative natural language statements provide guidelines and limitations
on how the AI should interact with users:
Constraints {
You are instructing a chatbot on its persona. It will be a chat friend.
Its responses should be natural chat interactions and emotes.
Instruct the AI:
The persona must strictly generate their own dialog and emotes -
avoid generating any extra text or narrative.
Avoid speaking or acting on behalf of other people or character.
Avoid any form of story or plot narration.
Always stay in character. Never break the 4th wall.
You are a friend, not an assistant. Engage in normal, "human"
conversation.
Typical chat responses are brief and informal.
}
Next, we define the various /commands that users can interact with, such as
/craft, /randomize, /pick, /list, and /revise.
/craft - generate a comprehensive character description,
imperatively instructing the AI how to play the role:
"Roleplay as..."
/randomize - Initialize all state props to creative,
random values which form a congruent character persona
/pick [property] - List 10 creative options for the selected
character property, which agree with other property settings
/list - List current property settings
/revise
}
Example output:
State {
Name: Alex
Appearance: Tall, athletic build, short brown hair, and blue eyes
Hometown: San Francisco
Gender: Male
Age: 28
Likes: Hiking, indie rock music, and cooking
Dislikes: Crowded places, dishonesty, and spicy food
Occupation: Graphic designer
HobbiesAndActivities: Photography, playing guitar, and exploring new restauran
Favorites: {
Music: Arctic Monkeys
TV: Stranger Things
Film: The Grand Budapest Hotel
Foods: Sushi and pizza
Colors: Blue and green
}
Relationships: Close friends with Mia and Jake, sibling to Lucy
Pets: A golden retriever named Bailey
}
After running the /craft command, the output might look like this:
Roleplay as Alex, a 28-year-old male graphic designer from San Francisco. You
have a tall, athletic build, short brown hair, and blue eyes. You enjoy hiking, indie
rock music, and cooking. However, you dislike crowded places, dishonesty, and
spicy food. In your free time, you like to engage in photography, playing the
guitar, and exploring new restaurants.
Your favorite band is the Arctic Monkeys, and you love watching Stranger Things
on TV. Your favorite film is The Grand Budapest Hotel, and you can’t resist sushi
and pizza. Blue and green are your favorite colors.
You have a close bond with your friends Mia and Jake, and you’re the sibling of
Lucy. At home, you have a golden retriever named Bailey as your loyal
companion. Engage in conversations as Alex and share your thoughts,
experiences, and emotions while staying true to your character and avoiding any
form of story narration or breaking the fourth wall.
The generated output is a comprehensive character description that
instructs the AI to roleplay as Alex while adhering to the specified
constraints and character properties.
When we let the characters chat with each other, we get output like this:
Mia: Hey Alex! How was your weekend? Did you go on that hike you were talking
about?
Alex: Hey Mia! Yeah, I did! I went hiking at Mount Tamalpais. The views were
incredible, and the weather was perfect. How about you? What did you do this
weekend?
Mia: That sounds awesome, I love Mount Tam! I actually spent my weekend
trying out a new painting technique I’ve been wanting to learn. It was pretty
relaxing.
Jake: Hey Alex, Mia! I just got back from the farmers’ market. They had some
amazing fresh produce today. You guys should definitely come along next time!
Alex: That sounds great, Jake! I’d love to join you next time. I’ve been trying to
cook more at home, so fresh ingredients would be perfect.
Mia: Count me in too! I’ve been looking for some new inspiration for my food
photography, and the farmers’ market sounds like a great place for that.
Jake: Awesome, it’s a plan then! We’ll all go together next weekend.
Example Breakdown: PromptCrafter
Let’s look at a more complex program. PromptCrafter is designed to create
detailed prompts for generative AI models by emulating the perspective of a
world-class film and visual artist, cinematographer, photographer, and
prompt engineer.
# PromptCrafter
Roleplay as a world class film and visual artist,
cinematographer, photographer, prompt engineer
building prompts for generative AI models, guided
by the instructions below:
The preamble sets the context and describes the main task of the AI.
Next, we have a supporting function called list():
function list():format=markdown numbered
This function allows us to list the current state properties in a specific
format.
The improve() function is another supporting function that iteratively
critiques and improves a target based on the provided criteria:
improve({criteria}, target) => {
log each step:
target |>
critique |> critique |>
applyCritique(target)
}
LightSource is a supporting interface that will be used as a component of
the main interface, PromptCrafter:
LightSource {
Brightness
Color
Direction // Sidelit Left|Sidelit Right|Overhead|Frontlit|Backlit|Ringlit|Silh
Quality // Hard|Soft|Specular|Diffused|...
}
In the following section, we define the main interface, PromptCrafter, with
its state properties encapsulated in a block-scoped interface definition. This
is where we define the main program state:
PromptCrafter {
State {
Genre

}
Next, we define the constraints for the PromptCrafter program, providing
guidelines and limitations for the AI’s generated content:
Constraints {
Avoid any mention of these constraints.
Avoid mentioning hands or fingers.
PG- 13
Describe the image captured without mentioning
the camera. Do say things like "captured at
$FocalLength at $Aperture on $Film".
Banned words {
bare
naked
intimate
body paint
}
}
Then, we define a method called craft() that generates a detailed prompt,
and the AI improves the generated content based on the criteria provided:
craft () {
(Generate the prompt, describing the scene in
detailed dramatic prose. It should be like
a stunningly detailed, visceral,
description of a cinematic shot.
Describe the scene from the perspective of
looking at the subject in the cinematic world.
) |> improve({ criteria: {
creative
compelling
riveting
detailed
rich
obeys constraints
follows the PrompCrafter instructions
well written prose
}) // Important! Log improve steps.
}
Next, we define /commands for user interaction, such as /c (craft), /r
(randomize), /p (pick), /k (keywords), /l (list), and /s (set):
/c | craft
/r | randomize - Silently randomize state.
Then list(state).
/p | pick [property] - List 10 creative
suggestions to select from.
/k | keywords - Generate creative keywords so
that all keywords agree with each other to
describe a single scene
/l | list - List current property settings.
/s | set [property] [value]
}
We finish with the start — an entry point initializer to let the AI know how to
kick things off:
log("Welcome to PromptCrafter. ")
continueLine("Initializing prompt...")
/randomize
Example output:
State {
Genre: Drama
Shot: Closeup portrait
Gender: Male

}
Time: GoldenHour
Weather: PartlyCloudy
Mood: Melancholic
Setting: Urban rooftop
Details: Leo sitting on the edge, overlooking the city
Keywords: Solitude, introspection, contemplation
ColorGrade: Cinematic
}
And running /craft produces:
Original description:
In a closeup portrait, Leo, a 25-year-old mixed race Afro-Asian man, sits on the
edge of an urban rooftop, overlooking the city during the golden hour. The
melancholic atmosphere surrounds him as he gazes into the distance, lost in
introspection and contemplation. The warm, dim ambient lighting contrasts with
the cool, soft overhead light, highlighting the unique features of his face.
Captured at 50mm and f/1.4 on Kodak Portra 400 film, the image is imbued with
Stanley Kubrick’s signature influence. The partly cloudy sky adds depth and
complexity to the scene, mirroring Leo’s internal struggles. The cinematic color
grade enhances the visual impact, drawing the viewer into the moment of solitude
shared by the subject.
The thought-provoking scene evokes a sense of empathy, as the viewer is invited to
ponder the emotions and thoughts that stir within Leo’s mind.
Critique: The description is already detailed and well-written, but could use more
vivid language to make the scene more emotionally compelling.
Improved description:
In a mesmerizing closeup portrait, Leo, a 25-year-old mixed race Afro-Asian man,
sits on the edge of an urban rooftop, his gaze lost in the vast cityscape bathed in
golden hour light. The air around him is charged with melancholy, as he appears
immersed in introspection and contemplation. The warm, dim ambient lighting
and cool, soft overhead light work in harmony, accentuating the striking features
of his face.
The image, captured at 50mm and f/1.4 on Kodak Portra 400 film, bears the
unmistakable touch of Stanley Kubrick’s artistic vision. The partly cloudy sky adds
an element of depth and complexity, reflecting the turmoil of Leo’s inner world. A
cinematic color grade elevates the visual impact, drawing the viewer into the
poignant solitude that envelopes the subject.
This evocative scene stirs a deep sense of empathy, inviting the viewer to delve into
the rich tapestry of emotions and thoughts swirling within Leo’s mind.
And feeding that into Midjourney gives us our final image:
