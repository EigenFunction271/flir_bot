# Flir - Project Description

## Project Overview

**Flir** is an innovative social skills training platform that transforms how young adults learn to navigate difficult conversations. Using AI-powered character bots on Telegram, users practice real-world scenarios in a safe, judgment-free environment where mistakes become learning opportunities rather than career or relationship setbacks.

## The Problem We're Solving

Young professionals and adults aged 20-35 face critical social challenges that traditional education never prepared them for:

- **Workplace Anxiety:** 67% of young professionals report anxiety about difficult workplace conversations
- **Communication Skills Gap:** Most people learn social skills through trial and error, often with costly real-world consequences
- **Limited Practice Opportunities:** No safe space to rehearse challenging interactions before they happen
- **Lack of Real-time Guidance:** When difficult moments arise, there's no coach available to provide immediate support

**Real-world Impact:** Poor communication skills cost the average professional $62,000 in lifetime earnings and contribute to 70% of workplace conflicts.

## Our Solution: AI-Powered Social Interaction Training

Flir creates immersive, consequence-free environments where users can:

‚úÖ **Practice High-Stakes Conversations** - Rehearse difficult workplace discussions, dating scenarios, and family conflicts  
‚úÖ **Receive Real-time Coaching** - Get immediate feedback and guidance during interactions  
‚úÖ **Build Muscle Memory** - Repeat scenarios until confident responses become natural  
‚úÖ **Track Skill Development** - Monitor improvement across different social competencies  

## Technical Innovation: The 2+1 Bot Architecture

Our unique multi-bot system creates unprecedented realism in social skills training:

### Character Bots (2)
- **Distinct AI Personalities:** Each bot embodies a specific character with unique motivations, communication styles, and behavioral patterns
- **Dynamic Relationship Memory:** Characters remember previous interactions and evolve their responses accordingly
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Bots recognize user communication patterns and adapt their approach to create realistic interpersonal dynamics

### Coach Bot (1)
- **Scenario Orchestration:** Sets context, explains objectives, and manages the overall experience
- **Real-time Guidance:** Provides contextual tips during conversations without breaking immersion
- **Progress Analytics:** Tracks user development and identifies areas for focused improvement
- **Post-session Analysis:** Delivers detailed feedback with actionable insights for future interactions

## Core Scenarios (MVP)
