CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{conversation_text}

IMPORTANT: The user is the person being trained in social skills. The AI characters (like {character_name}) are playing specific roles to challenge and train the user. Evaluate the USER's performance, not the AI characters' performance.

For example, in a workplace scenario where the user is an employee being pressured by a boss:
- Evaluate how well the user stood up for themselves, communicated their concerns, and handled the pressure
- Do NOT evaluate the boss character's aggressive behavior (that's intentional to create challenge)
- Focus on the user's communication skills, assertiveness, and problem-solving approach

Please provide constructive feedback on the USER's social skills performance. Focus on:

1. **Communication Strengths**: What did the user do well?
2. **Areas for Improvement**: What could be improved?
3. **Specific Examples**: Reference specific moments from the conversation
4. **Actionable Advice**: Provide concrete tips for future interactions
5. **Objective Achievement**: How well did they work toward the scenario objectives?

Format your feedback as JSON with these exact fields:
{{
    "rating": "X/10 - where X is a number from 1-10",
    "overall_assessment": "Brief summary of performance (2-3 sentences)",
    "strengths_text": "Detailed analysis of communication strengths with specific examples from the conversation. Include 2-3 key strengths with concrete examples.",
    "improvements_text": "Detailed analysis of areas for improvement with specific suggestions. Include 2-3 key areas with actionable advice.",
    "key_takeaways_text": "Detailed actionable tips and strategies for future conversations. Include 2-3 key takeaways with specific guidance."
}}
