## Before & After Comparison

### BEFORE (Prose Biography)

**Biography:**
```
You are a 50-year old high-functioning sociopath who has been in the 
industry for 30 years. You have succeeded in everything you have done...
```

**In Prompt (Truncated)**:
```
Biography: You are a 50-year old high-functioning soci...
```
- Only 200 chars shown
- Important context lost
- Hard to parse

### AFTER (SudoLang Biography)

**Biography:**
```
Marcus {
    Profile {
        Age: 50
        Role: Senior Executive
        Experience: 30 years in industry
        Type: High-functioning sociopath
    }
    
    DefiningMoments {
        - Backstabbed closest friend for promotion
        - Drinks nightly to cope with guilt
        - Questions own humanity
    }
    
    CoreBeliefs {

    }
    
    Behavioral {
        - Despises anyone who questions authority
        - Will fire people without hesitation
    }
    
    Triggers {
        Excuses → RAGE + firing threats
        Questions → CONTEMPT + dismissal
    }
}
```

**In Prompt (Full Structure)**:
```
Biography:
    Marcus {
        Profile { Age: 50, Role: Senior Executive, Type: High-functioning sociopath }
        DefiningMoments {
            - Backstabbed closest friend for promotion
            - Drinks nightly to cope with guilt
            [ALL details included - no truncation]
        }
        CoreBeliefs { ... }
        Behavioral { ... }
        Triggers {
            Excuses → RAGE + firing threats
            Questions → CONTEMPT + dismissal
            [Explicit mood mappings]
        }
    }
```

- All context preserved
- Explicit trigger-to-mood mappings
- Easy for LLM to parse sections

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. **No More Truncation**

- **Benefit**: LLM sees complete character depth

### 2. **Explicit Trigger Mappings**
```
Triggers {
    Excuses or delays → RAGE + firing threats
    Questions → CONTEMPT + immediate dismissal
    Data → SKEPTICAL + intense scrutiny
}
```
- LLM immediately knows: "Excuse" → "RAGE"
- Improves mood inference accuracy
- Makes behavioral rules more predictable

### 3. **Structured Sections**
- Profile (age, role, background)
- DefiningMoments (key life events)
- CoreBeliefs (fundamental worldview)
- Behavioral (typical actions)
- Triggers (mood mappings)
- Relationships (context)

**Benefit**: LLM can scan and extract specific information quickly

### 4. **Consistency Across All Characters**
- Same template structure
- Same section names
- Same level of detail
- Easy to compare and maintain

---

## Migration Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Refactored all 19 character biographies to SudoLang
2. ✅ Updated prompt generation to include full biography
3. ✅ Added `_format_biography_for_prompt()` helper method
4. ✅ Tested all characters load correctly
5. ✅ Verified prompts include full structure
6. ✅ No linting errors

### 📝 What Changed

**Modified Files:**
- `characters.py` - All 19 character biographies refactored + prompt method updated

**New Functionality:**
- `_format_biography_for_prompt()` - Automatically formats biographies for prompts

**Backward Compatible:**
- Works with both SudoLang and prose biographies
- Old sessions still work
- Serialization unchanged

---

## Usage Examples

### Testing with Dev Tools

```bash
python character_dev_tools.py

# Test Marcus in angry mood
>>> /test_mood marcus angry "I can't do it"

# See how triggers map to moods
>>> /list_rules marcus angry

# View full prompt with SudoLang biography
>>> /show_prompt marcus frustrated "I need help"
```

### In Production

Characters automatically use full SudoLang biographies:

```python
# No code changes needed!
# Your bot automatically uses new format:

prompt = character.generate_dynamic_prompt(
    mood_state=mood,
    user_message="test",
    scenario_context="test"
)

# Prompt now includes:
# - Full biography (not truncated)
# - Explicit trigger mappings
# - All character context
```

---

## Expected Impact

### Character Response Quality

**Before** (truncated prose):
```
Marcus: "We don't have time for this. Just get it done."
```
- Generic response
- Doesn't reflect sociopathic depth
- Missing intimidation factor

**After** (full SudoLang):
```
Marcus: "STOP. I don't CARE about your problems. You SAID you could handle it. Either DELIVER or I'll find someone who actually CAN. This is your last chance."
```
- Uses CAPS (angry mood behavior)
- Reflects sociopathic manipulation
- Threatens job (trigger: excuses → rage + firing threats)
- Shows ruthless nature from biography
- More authentic to character depth

### Why It's Better

1. **LLM sees explicit triggers**: "Excuses → RAGE" is crystal clear
2. **Full context available**: Sociopathic nature, drinking problem, backstabbing history
3. **Structured parsing**: LLM scans sections independently
4. **Mood integration**: Triggers directly map to CharacterMood enum

## Verification

### Quick Test

```python
from characters import CharacterManager, MoodState, CharacterMood

cm = CharacterManager()
marcus = cm.get_character('marcus')

# Check biography
print(f"Biography length: {len(marcus.biography)} chars")  # ~2000 chars
print("Has triggers:", "Triggers {" in marcus.biography)   # True

# Test prompt generation
mood = MoodState(CharacterMood.ANGRY, 0.85, "Test")
prompt = marcus.generate_dynamic_prompt(mood, "test", "scenario")

print(f"Prompt length: {len(prompt)} chars")  # ~4500 chars
print("Full biography included:", "Triggers {" in prompt)  # True
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Biography length: 1969 chars
Has triggers: True
Prompt length: 4432 chars
